GitHub Page: https://<your-username>.github.io

-----------------------------------------------------
Project Overview:
-----------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the code for my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. The website showcases my academic background, technical skills, achievements, and provides a downloadable link to my CV. Additionally, it includes JavaScript functionality for tracking user interaction with the page (clicks and views), as well as a text analysis tool.

-----------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. All code for the website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained in a single file: `Q1.html`.
2. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is accessible through the provided link.
3. Images (profile and hometown) are located in the `images/` folder.
4. The CV is available for download as a PDF via a link in the website.
5. JavaScript is used to capture click and view events across HTML elements and logs them to the browser console.
6. The text analysis tool requires at least 10,000 words to function correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------
Features:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. **About Me Section**:  
   A brief introduction about myself, my background, and interests.
   
2. **Photos Section**:  
   Displays a profile picture and images from my hometown.
   
3. **Education & Achievements Section**:  
   Details about my educational history, schools, and notable achievements.
   
4. **Technical Skills Section**:  
   A list of the technical skills I have acquired, categorized by expertise levels.

5. **CV Download**:  
   A hyperlink to download my CV in PDF format.

6. **JavaScript Event Tracking**:  
   Captures all click and page view events and logs them in the browser console.
   - When an element is clicked (e.g., text, images, links), the timestamp and event type are logged.
   - Page views are also logged when the page loads.

7. **Text Analysis Tool**:  
   A text box is provided where the user can input text (with more than 10,000 words) to perform the following analyses:
   - **Word Count**: Displays the total number of letters, words, spaces, newlines, and special symbols.
   - **Pronoun Count**: Identifies and counts different pronouns in the input text.
   - **Preposition Count**: Identifies and counts prepositions in the text.
   - **Indefinite Article Count**: Identifies and counts indefinite articles (a, an, the).

-----------------------------------------------------
Execution Instructions:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Open the following URL in your browser:
   https://<your-username>.github.io

2. All website content is generated from a single file: `Q1.html`. No additional files need to be loaded separately.

3. **Event Logging**:  
   - Open your browserâ€™s Developer Tools (Right-click > Inspect > Console) to see logs of events.
   - Interact with different page elements such as images, links, and text boxes. Each interaction (click/view) will log the following information in the console:
     - Timestamp of event
     - Type of event (click or view)
     - Type of element (image, text, link, etc.)

4. **Text Analysis**:  
   - Scroll to the "Text Analysis" section at the bottom of the page.
   - Paste a large text (preferably more than 10,000 words) into the provided text box.
   - Click the **"Analyze Text"** button to process the text and see the following results:
     - Number of letters, words, spaces, newlines, and special characters.
     - Token counts for different pronouns, prepositions, and indefinite articles used in the text.

-----------------------------------------------------
Files Included in the ZIP:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. **`Q1.html`**  
   - Contains the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the personal website.

2. **`cv.pdf`**  
   - My CV, available for download from the website.

3. **`images/`**  
   - A folder containing the images used on the website, including:
     - `profile.jpg`: My profile picture.
     - `hometown1.jpg`, `hometown2.jpg`: Images from my hometown.

   - This file, explaining the project, assumptions, and instructions.

5. **`github_io_link.txt`**  
   - Contains the live link to the GitHub Pages site for easy access.

-----------------------------------------------------
Important Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------
- The website is responsive and should work across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser for event tracking and text analysis functionality to work correctly.
- The text analysis tool is designed for larger inputs (over 10,000 words). Smaller inputs may not produce meaningful results.
- If the text analysis results don't appear immediately, try pasting more text (ideally 10,000 words or more).
